# Steganography-Java
###Current Implementation Stage: 1

This is my implementation of a basic steganography application for Java. This project will be completed in phases, stage 1 will just get pictures being read in and pixels to be changed. Stage 2: Will try to implement better mathematics to further mask pixel change. NOTE* Stage 1 will not implement any mathematics to mask pixels, they will be changed accordingly, and it will be noticeable.
